Customized zsh settings. Contains .zshrc, a custom theme and a plugin for
faster access to my Go repsoitories.

Use setup.sh for a quick start. This will download and set up oh-my-zsh and
apply my customizations.

May require a relog as $SHELL is not correctly set. Try
> $SHELL <Enter>
> $0 <Enter>

If $SHELL set to anything but /bin/zsh relog and $SHELL should be /bin/zsh.
